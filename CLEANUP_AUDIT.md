# Cleanup Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Purpose:** Identify files to delete/archive based on Agent Safeguard System completion

---

## 🗑️ SAFE TO DELETE (Recommended)

### 1. Deprecated Agent Files (Should be consolidated per Week 5 plan)

**Delete these agents (replaced by Code Guardian):**
```bash
# These are consolidated into code-guardian.md
rm .claude/agents/backend-developer.md          # 1.6K - Replaced by Code Guardian
rm .claude/agents/frontend-developer.md         # 1.9K - Replaced by Code Guardian
```

**Rationale:** Week 5 plan consolidates Backend + Frontend Developer into Code Guardian
**Savings:** ~3.5K of duplicate agent prompts
**Risk:** LOW (functionality moved to code-guardian.md)

---

### 2. Duplicate Documentation Files

**Delete duplicates (keep canonical versions in TEEEM_DOCS/):**
```bash
# Gantt documentation duplicated across 4 locations
rm public/GANTT_BIBLE.md                        # Keep in frontend/public/
rm public/GANTT_BIBLE_COLUMNS.md
rm public/GANTT_BUG_HUNTER_LEXICON.md
rm public/GANTT_DRAG_FLICKER_FIXES.md

rm backend/public/GANTT_BIBLE.md                # Keep in frontend/public/
rm backend/public/GANTT_BIBLE_COLUMNS.md
rm backend/public/GANTT_BUG_HUNTER_LEXICON.md
rm backend/public/GANTT_DRAG_FLICKER_FIXES.md

# Keep in frontend/dist/ if that's the build output
# OR keep in frontend/public/ (the source)
# Delete whichever is NOT the canonical source
```

**Rationale:** Same Gantt docs exist in 4 places (root/public, backend/public, frontend/public, frontend/dist)
**Savings:** ~200K of duplicate files
**Risk:** LOW (keep one canonical location)

---

### 3. Old Implementation Summaries (Completed work)

**Archive or delete (work is done):**
```bash
# Move to ARCHIVE/ or delete
mv SUBCONTRACTOR_PORTAL_SUMMARY.md ARCHIVE/
mv SUBCONTRACTOR_PORTAL_TEST.md ARCHIVE/
mv FINANCIAL_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION.md ARCHIVE/
mv FRONTEND_FINANCIAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md ARCHIVE/
mv PAY_NOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md ARCHIVE/
mv WHS_IMPLEMENTATION.md ARCHIVE/
mv CORPORATE_API_REFERENCE.md ARCHIVE/
mv CORPORATE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md ARCHIVE/
mv SENTRY_SETUP.md ARCHIVE/               # Sentry is set up
mv TESTING_GUIDE.md ARCHIVE/              # If not actively used
```

**Rationale:** These are completed implementation summaries (historical value only)
**Savings:** ~50K of outdated implementation docs
**Risk:** LOW (can move to ARCHIVE instead of delete)

---

### 4. Temporary/Session Files

**Safe to delete:**
```bash
rm BUG_HUNTER_SESSION_2025-11-20.md       # Temporary session file
rm TABLE_DELETION_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt     # Bug resolved
rm TABLE_DELETION_REPORT_SUMMARY.txt      # Bug resolved
rm INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.txt              # Old investigation
rm supplier_category_quick_reference.txt   # Quick ref (likely in docs)
rm backend/tmp/restart.txt                # Temp file
```

**Rationale:** Temporary debugging/session files, bugs are resolved
**Savings:** ~20K
**Risk:** ZERO (temporary files)

---

### 5. Old Chapter 19 Research Files (Consolidated)

**Delete (consolidated into TEEEM_DOCS):**
```bash
# Chapter 19 research is complete and in Trinity Bible now
rm TEEEM_DOCS/CHAPTER_19_CODE_EXAMPLES.md
rm TEEEM_DOCS/CHAPTER_19_IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md
rm TEEEM_DOCS/CHAPTER_19_LEXICON_RESEARCH.md
rm TEEEM_DOCS/CHAPTER_19_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md
rm TEEEM_DOCS/CONTINUATION_INSTRUCTIONS_CHAPTER_19.md
```

**Rationale:** Chapter 19 is complete and in Trinity system, research files no longer needed
**Savings:** ~30K
**Risk:** LOW (info is in Trinity Bible now)

---

### 6. Duplicate/Old Trinity Docs

**Keep the main files, delete backups:**
```bash
rm TEEEM_DOCS/TEEEM_TEACHER_OLD.md      # Old version (keep current)
rm TEEEM_DOCS/TEEEM_BIBLE.md.bak        # If it exists (backup)
```

**Rationale:** Old versions superseded by current Trinity docs
**Savings:** ~50K
**Risk:** LOW (backups only)

---

## ⚠️ ARCHIVE (Don't delete, move to ARCHIVE/)

### 1. Old Rapid Rebuild Plans

**Move to ARCHIVE/:**
```bash
mv rapid-rebuild-plan.md ARCHIVE/
mv backend/rapid-rebuild-plan.md ARCHIVE/
mv docs/rapid-rebuild-plan.md ARCHIVE/
```

**Rationale:** Historical planning docs, may have value for reference
**Risk:** MEDIUM (keep in ARCHIVE)

---

### 2. Old Investigation Files (Already in ARCHIVE/investigations)

**Already properly archived - no action needed:**
```
✅ ARCHIVE/investigations/TABLE_DELETION_*.md
✅ ARCHIVE/investigations/TIMEZONE_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md
```

---

### 3. Old Docs (Legacy)

**Move to ARCHIVE/:**
```bash
mv docs/archive/GANTT_BIBLE_COLUMNS.md ARCHIVE/
mv docs/archive/GANTT_SCHEDULE_RULES_OLD.md ARCHIVE/
```

**Already in docs/archive, could move to main ARCHIVE/**

## ⚡ Quick Cleanup Commands

### Conservative Cleanup (Archive Everything):
```bash
# Archive deprecated agents
mkdir -p ARCHIVE/old-agents
mv .claude/agents/backend-developer.md ARCHIVE/old-agents/
mv .claude/agents/frontend-developer.md ARCHIVE/old-agents/

# Archive old implementations
mkdir -p ARCHIVE/old-implementations
mv SUBCONTRACTOR_PORTAL_*.md ARCHIVE/old-implementations/
mv *_IMPLEMENTATION.md ARCHIVE/old-implementations/
mv CORPORATE_*.md ARCHIVE/old-implementations/

# Delete temp files only
rm BUG_HUNTER_SESSION_2025-11-20.md
rm TABLE_DELETION_*.txt
rm INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.txt

# Delete duplicates (keep frontend/public/)
rm public/GANTT_*.md
rm backend/public/GANTT_*.md
```

### Aggressive Cleanup (Delete More):
```bash
# Run conservative cleanup first, then:

# Delete old research (consolidated in Trinity)
rm TEEEM_DOCS/CHAPTER_19_*.md
rm TEEEM_DOCS/CONTINUATION_INSTRUCTIONS_CHAPTER_19.md
rm TEEEM_DOCS/TEEEM_TEACHER_OLD.md

# Delete archived implementations (if confident)
rm -rf ARCHIVE/old-implementations/
```

## 🎯 Recommendations

**Recommended Approach: Conservative Cleanup**
1. Archive deprecated agents (backend-developer, frontend-developer)
2. Archive completed implementations (move to ARCHIVE/)
3. Delete temporary/session files (safe)
4. Delete duplicate Gantt docs (keep frontend/public/)
5. Keep old research for now (can delete later if Trinity Bible is sufficient)

**Total Savings: ~200-250K**
**Risk Level: LOW**

**Next Review:** After Week 4-5 implementation
- Delete more agents once consolidation is complete
- Review ARCHIVE/ for truly obsolete files

---

**Audit Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Recommendation:** Execute conservative cleanup script
**Estimated Time:** 2 minutes
**Risk:** LOW (archives instead of deleting most files)
